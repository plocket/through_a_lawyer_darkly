      It's hard for non-native English readers to understand well-written English.
      It's hard for a native English reader to get a sense of what that feels like. You
      can give this a shot and tell me if it helps at all.

      I'm going to give you some text that's already hard to read and then give
      you a weird way to read it. Then you explain what you read. To give you
      a fair start, I'll tell you it's about housing eviction in Wisconsin.

      P.S. These instructions are for coders. I haven't yet made a custom tool
      that can do this.
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Copy the text below. Avoid pasting it anywhere so that the text will be new to you when you read it later.</li>
      <li>Go to <a href="http://www.sprintreader.com/">Sprint Reader</a>.</li>
      <li>Scroll down to the demo.</li>
      <li>
        <span>Open the developer tools and, in the console, paste and run this:</span>
        <p><code>document.querySelector('#spritz').style.transform = 'rotate(180deg)';</code></p>
      </li>
      <li>Paste the text in your clipboard into the textbox.</li>
      <li>Slow down the text to about 40 or so.</li>
      <li>Press "Play".</li>
