      Until you file your motion with the court,&nbsp;the parent who owes child support still owes the amount in your current order.<br>
      
      For example<br>
      
      - Under your current order, the children spend Sunday to Friday with you and Friday after school until Sunday after dinner with the other parent.<br>
      - Child support was calculated based on the children being with you 5 overnights each week, and with the other parent 2 overnights each week.<br>
      - You decide to change to a schedule where the children will spend a week with you and then a week with the other parent. You start March 1.<br>
      - Child support will probably change because the percentage of overnights the children spend with each parent has changed.<br>
      - You file an Uncontested Motion to Modify Custody and Child Support June 21.<br>
      - The judge agrees with your motion and signs a new custody and child support order September 1.<br>
      - The new order says that the new child support amount starts July 1.<br>
      - Because you did not file your motion until June, the original child support amount still applies from March until July 1.
